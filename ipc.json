But if A,\n    not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the\n    ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may\n    intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or\n    such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n    (c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of\n    a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder,\n    although he may not have intended to cause Z’s death.\n    (d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one\n    of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any\n    particular individual.\n    Exception 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the\n    power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who\n    gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident:\n    Provided that the provocation is not,––\n    (a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or\n    doing harm to any person;\n    (b) given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the\n    lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant;\n    (c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\n    Explanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent\n    the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.\n    Murder.\n   \n    Illustrations.\n    (a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally\n    kills Y, Z’s child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and\n    the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the\n    provocation.\n    (b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at\n    Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight.\n    A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n    (c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by\n    the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing\n    done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.\n    (d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a\n    word of A’s deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by\n    these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n    (e) A attempts to pull Z’s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays\n    hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in\n    consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was giving by a thing\n    done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n    (f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending\n    to take advantage of B’s rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B’s hand for that\n    purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A\n    is guilty of murder.\n    Exception 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good\n    faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by\n    law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence\n    without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for\n    the purpose of such defence.\n    Illustration.\n    Z attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A\n    draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by no other\n    means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed\n    murder, but only culpable homicide.\n    Exception 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant\n    or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers\n    given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be\n    lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without\n    ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.\n    Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation\n    in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender’s\n    having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\n    Explanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or\n    commits the first assault.\n    Exception 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused,\n    being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own\n    consent.\n    Illustration.\n    A, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child to commit suicide. Here, on account of\n    Z’s youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted\n    murder",

Theft : (1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the\n    possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to\n    such taking, is said to commit theft.\n    Explanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable\n    property, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as\n    soon as it is severed from the earth.\n    Explanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may\n    be a theft.\n    Explanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle\n    which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by\n    actually moving it.\n    Explanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to\n    move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused,\n    is moved by that animal.\n    Explanation 5.—The consent mentioned in this section may be express or implied,\n    and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that\n    purpose authority either express or implied.\n    Illustrations.\n    (a) A cuts down a tree on Z’s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree\n    out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order\n    to such taking, he has committed theft.\n    (b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z’s dog to follow it. Here, if\n    A’s intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent. A\n    has committed theft as soon as Z’s dog has begun to follow A.\n    (c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\n    direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins\n    to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n    (d) A being Z’s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z’s plate, dishonestly runs\n    away with the plate, without Z’s consent. A has committed theft.\n    (e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall\n    return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z’s possession.\n    It could not therefore be taken out of Z’s possession, and A has not committed theft, though\n    he may have committed criminal breach of trust. (f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring\n    is in Z’s possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n    (g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by\n    taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n    (h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z’s house. Not venturing to\n    misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a\n    place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking\n    the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of\n    first moving the ring, commits theft.\n    (i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not\n    owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain the watch as a\n    security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z’s hand, and carries it away.\n    Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed\n    theft, in as much as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n    (j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as\n    a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z’s possession, with the intention of\n    depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, in as much as he takes\n    it dishonestly.\n    (k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z’s possession without\n    Z’s consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the\n    watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n    (l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z’s possession without Z’s consent, with\n    the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here\n    A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n    (m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z’s library in Z’s absence, and takes\n    away a book without Z’s express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the\n    intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z’s\n    implied consent to use Z’s book. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n    (n) A asks charity from Z’s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows\n    to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z’s wife is authorised\n    to give away alms. If this was A’s impression, A has not committed theft.\n    (o) A is the paramour of Z’s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to\n    belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If\n    A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n    (p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A’s own property, takes\n    that property out of Z’s possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not\n    commit theft.\n    (2) Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description\n    for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both and in case of second\n    or subsequent conviction of any person under this section, he shall be punished with\n    rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend\n    to five years and with fine:\n    Provided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five\n    thousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of the value\n    of property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with community service.
